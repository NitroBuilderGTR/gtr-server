      <article class="container" id="one"> <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <a>So around the middle of 2020 to late 2019, I had been playing a very popular game called "Fortnite", and I was about 11 to 12 at the time, and I thought "Wow this looks really cool, and it's really successful as well". So as any kid would, I started to try to do my research - like what Game Engine did Fortnite use? How do I make a Multiplayer Game? What is a better game engine? What one is easier for beginners? Those kind of questions. </a>
        <p></p>
        <a>Then, after about 3 months of hard work, I had made a 1st version of a </a> <a id="bold-text">*very*</a> <a>basic Multiplayer Game in UE4. I actually still have the OG files for the game. Originaly, I was going to call GTR_Server "Nitro_Server".</a>

      <article class="container" id="two"><h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <a>So, when I made the 1st version, The game was actually called Nitro_Server. The main idea for this game, was to make a Social Media inside of my game, but I wanted it to be like a 3D Social Media, somewhere where people can host and create their own Game Servers, and be proud of their own communities In - Game. The only issue was that I had no communication System. That meant NO Chat system. Nothing. Thats when I failed. I had to start all over again. Obviously I was drained from motivation, so I took a VERY long break. I stopped coding for about 3 months or more. I really had no motivation. I then told myself that I need to go back to my project, or I will never finish it - it can't complete itself. So I just rebuilt The Entire Game. Re - named it to GTR_Server. Found a Chat - System for UE4 that someone on YouTube had made as a tutorial</a> <A><a id="bold-text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCf4BWJDpbA">(tutorial can be found here)</a></A> <a>it's useful thank you so much :). I then spent about a Year coding the core parts of the Game itself - The Cars, Doors, Houses, Username System, and the most difficult part - The Respawn System. That was the most buggy, error - filled system I ever made. Lots of people in The UE4 Community have issues making a UE4 Multiplayer - Ready Respawn System, and a Chair System, because they are so advanced for some reason. </a>
